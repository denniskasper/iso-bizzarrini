/**
 * What the API promises the browser, declared once.
 *
 * The API and the app are one deployable (ADR 0008) but two builds, and before this existed
 * each response shape was written down twice — once where it is produced, once where it is
 * consumed — with nothing keeping the two honest. Every ticket from here adds Tavole,
 * Positions, Marks, Parts and Listings to that surface, so the duplication was going to
 * multiply.
 *
 * **Types only.** This package emits no JavaScript and is consumed with `import type`, so it
 * needs no build step and appears in neither bundle. Do not put a constant, a function or an
 * enum here — the moment something in here has to exist at runtime, this stops being free and
 * both apps need a compiled dependency.
